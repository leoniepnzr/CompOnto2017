Equipment needed:

- Microcontroller, like Gemma or Flora (by Adafruit)

- RGB LED pixel on PCB board

- Thin wire

- Coin battery pack + 2 coin batteries (withV according to the microcontroller, in
this case 5V)

- Hair clip

- Soldering iron

- Hot glue gun

- Micro USB cable

Optional, depending on use:

- 2 pin JST plug (if not included in battery pack)

- Additional Hair clips for attachment and embellishment

- Liquid Latex

- Make up



Assembly:

Trim the wire to your preference. You need three parts of wire between every LED and as a connection from the first LED to the microcontroller.
Remove the isolation from the tips of the wires and use soldering iron to
connect the LEDs with the wires. Pay attention to the alignment of the LEDs.

Connect your strip of LEDs to the microcontroller, again considering the
allignment. Ground gets connected to - and V gets connected to +. The
remaining wire gets connected to a pin, depending on the controller – we
used #10.
Connect the battery pack to ground and Vbatt, using soldering iron or use a
2 pin JST-plug.
Using a hot glue gun, connect the battery pack to the bottom of the
controller.
Glue a hair clip to the bottom of the battery pack.
Isolate the backs of your LEDs, e.g. with the hot glue gun.
Search for or write a code according to your use and preferences.
Upload the code onto your controller, attach the jewellery to a place of your
choice, turn on the battery pack (with batteries inside) and have fun!


Attachment:

The attachment of the LED jewellery depends solely on you. You have to decide what you want the final result to look like. However, we got a few suggestions:

For the necklace, we simply tied leftover wire to the end of the last LED and connected it to the hair clip on the back of the controller.

For the hair jewellery, we clipped the controller into the hair on the back of the head, wrapped the wire once around the ponytail for additional support and then secured the string in the hair with clips. In this case we used special hair-rings, for a cooler look but any hair clip does the job.

For the highlighter, we clipped the controller into the hair on the side of the head and attached the LEDs to the skin, using liquid latex. Just apply the latex to the back of a LED, with a brush and press it onto the skin. Hold it in place for a few seconds to let it dry and make sure nothing shifts. If you want an extra special effect, apply additional powder highlighter and/or glitter onto your cheekbones, above the LEDs.

Using the same method, you can accessorise costumes with the LED jewellery as well, e.g. for Halloween. Apply the latex to the back of the LEDs and attach them to any exposed part of the face of body, to complete your outfit and use make up to boost the effect further. Using it on the face, it can also be viewed as your personal, offline snapchat filter.

The main purpose of the LED jewellery is to have fun with it.

So get creative with it, show off a little to your friends and do just that!
